# Adams-Snake-Game
Hello and welcome to my Snake Game.

#Introduction about myself
My name is Adam Atallah, I am a student studying Bachelors of Artificial Intelligence. This project is my 2nd semester final. I hope you like it!

# Game Objective and How to play
Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a classic Snake game using the Pygame library in Python using Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Inheritance, and Modules. OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software. This approach enhances code reusability, readability, and ease of maintenance. Inheritance allows us to define a child class that inherits all the methods and properties from a parent class. Modules are simply files with the “. py” extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Modules Operations Program. I take advantage of modules to split up my code into sections making it easier to debug and locate something. The game will involve controlling a snakes’ movement with the aim to consume the apple without colliding with the borders causing the snake to get longer while simultaneously increasing your score and allowing you to play longer.
How to play:
Run the main.py code. The pygame window will open, press on it and using the arrows on your keyboard or the WASD keys, select a direction to go. Get to the apple and once the snake head reaches the apple your score will increase by 1 and another apple will be placed. Avoid the borders of the grid as well as colliding the snake head with it’s body. Because if you collide with them the game will end. Please press 1 key at once, as pressing 2 keys at once could result in the game ending depending on the circumstances. Last but not least, aim to eat as many apples as possible and have fun!
Please read the DOC strings in the code for better visualisation and understanding.

#Note
If you run the game and it prints out “ Final score 0 “ without you playing, just run it again and it will work.

Please do not hesitate to ask any questions, especially if you face any errors.
